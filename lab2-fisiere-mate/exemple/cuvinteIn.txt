I'm not sure the Voyetra 8 was actually the first rack-mount analog.
Certainly the first commercial one I know of, particularly a poly synth, which is really what we’ve been talking about. It wasn’t easy to cram the guts of an analog poly synth with 70s technology.
I remember a review of a rack-mount monophonic analog synth in Keyboard Magazine back in the seventies. I can't remember the make or model, but I don't think it was made by any of the well-known companies, and I don't think it was a success. About all i remember about it was that it came with a separate keyboard, like the ARP 2600, and everything else was in a 19'' rack enclosure. Maybe someone else here remembers more about it.
It doesn't ring a bell here. It could be a prototype that was never made commercially, or it could have just made very little impact. The only other thing I can think of is the fairly rare rack RSF Kobol Expander - an analog monosynth... dated to 1979 according to the internets. It doesn't really fit with the teaser/clues, though.
